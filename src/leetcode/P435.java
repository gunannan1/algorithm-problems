/**
 * Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals
 * you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

 Note:
 You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
 Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.
 Example 1:
 Input: [ [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,3] ]

 Output: 1

 Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.
 Example 2:
 Input: [ [1,2], [1,2], [1,2] ]

 Output: 2

 Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.
